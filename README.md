# 🌌 Starlight Vision 🚀

![Starlight](starlight.png)
🪐 Starlight Vision is a powerful multi-modal AI model designed to generate high-quality novel videos using text, images, or video clips as input. By leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, it can synthesize realistic and visually impressive video content that can be used in a variety of applications, such as movie production, advertising, virtual reality, and more. 🎥

## 🌟 Features

- 📝 Generate videos from text descriptions
- 🌃 Convert images into video sequences
- 📼 Extend existing video clips with novel content
- 🔮 High-quality output with customizable resolution
- 🧠 Easy to use API for quick integration

## 📦 Installation

To install Starlight Vision, simply use pip:

```bash
pip install starlight-vision
```

## 🎬 Quick Start

After we train you can install Starlight Vision and can start generating videos using the following code:

```python
from starlight_vision import StarlightVision

# Initialize the model
model = StarlightVision()

# Generate a video from a text description
video = model.generate_video_from_text("A flock of birds flying over a beautiful lake during sunset.")

# Save the generated video
video.save("output.mp4")
```

## 🛠 Usage

### 📄 Generating Videos from Text

```python
video = model.generate_video_from_text("A person riding a bike in a park.", duration=10, resolution=(1280, 720))
```

### 🖼 Generating Videos from Images

```python
from PIL import Image

input_image = Image.open("example_image.jpg")
video = model.generate_video_from_image(input_image, duration=5, resolution=(1280, 720))
```

### 🎞 Generating Videos from Video Clips

```python
from moviepy.editor import VideoFileClip

input_clip = VideoFileClip("example_clip.mp4")
video = model.generate_video_from_clip(input_clip, duration=10, resolution=(1280, 720))
```

- [ ] Train on LAION-5B and video datasets
- [ ] Enhance the quality of generated videos through the implementation of state-of-the-art generative models
- [ ] Optimize the model for real-time video generation on various devices, including mobile phones and edge devices
- [ ] Develop a user-friendly web application that allows users to generate videos using Starlight Vision without any programming knowledge
- [ ] Create comprehensive documentation and tutorials to help users get started with Starlight Vision

### 🌌 Medium-term Goals

- [ ] Integrate advanced style transfer techniques to allow users to customize the visual style of generated videos
- [ ] Develop a plugin for popular video editing software (e.g., Adobe Premiere, Final Cut Pro) that enables users to utilize Starlight Vision within their existing workflows
- [ ] Enhance the model's ability to generate videos with multiple scenes and complex narratives
- [ ] Improve the model's understanding of object interactions and physics to generate more realistic videos
- [ ] Expand the supported input formats to include audio, 3D models, and other media types

### 🌠 Long-term Goals

- [ ] Enable users to control the generated video with more granular parameters, such as lighting, camera angles, and object placement
- [ ] Incorporate AI-driven video editing capabilities that automatically adjust the pacing, color grading, and transitions based on user preferences
- [ ] Develop an API for real-time video generation that can be integrated into virtual reality, augmented reality, and gaming applications
- [ ] Investigate methods for training Starlight Vision on custom datasets to generate domain-specific videos
- [ ] Foster a community of researchers, developers, and artists to collaborate on the continued development and exploration of Starlight Vision's capabilities
