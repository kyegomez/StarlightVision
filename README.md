# 🌌 Starlight Vision 🚀

🪐 Starlight Vision is a powerful multi-modal AI model designed to generate high-quality novel videos using text, images, or video clips as input. By leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, it can synthesize realistic and visually impressive video content that can be used in a variety of applications, such as movie production, advertising, virtual reality, and more. 🎥

## 🌟 Features

- 📝 Generate videos from text descriptions
- 🌃 Convert images into video sequences
- 📼 Extend existing video clips with novel content
- 🔮 High-quality output with customizable resolution
- 🧠 Easy to use API for quick integration

## 📦 Installation

To install Starlight Vision, simply use pip:

```bash
pip install starlight-vision
```

## 🎬 Quick Start

After installing Starlight Vision, you can start generating videos using the following code:

```python
from starlight_vision import StarlightVision

# Initialize the model
model = StarlightVision()

# Generate a video from a text description
video = model.generate_video_from_text("A flock of birds flying over a beautiful lake during sunset.")

# Save the generated video
video.save("output.mp4")
```

## 🛠 Usage

### 📄 Generating Videos from Text

```python
video = model.generate_video_from_text("A person riding a bike in a park.", duration=10, resolution=(1280, 720))
```

### 🖼 Generating Videos from Images

```python
from PIL import Image

input_image = Image.open("example_image.jpg")
video = model.generate_video_from_image(input_image, duration=5, resolution=(1280, 720))
```

### 🎞 Generating Videos from Video Clips

```python
from moviepy.editor import VideoFileClip

input_clip = VideoFileClip("example_clip.mp4")
video = model.generate_video_from_clip(input_clip, duration=10, resolution=(1280, 720))
```
